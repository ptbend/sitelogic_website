              <p>Honesty and pragmatism are two things that mean a lot to me, and they&#39;re core values of Sitelogic. My hope is that this post demonstrates a little of both and gives some context for why I think this agency has a special role to play in the world of digital.</p>
              <h3 id="why-start-something-new-">Why start something new?</h3>
              <p>I&#39;ve heard people say they want to be an entrepreneur for &quot;flexibility&quot; and &quot;autonomy.&quot; While these things are great, they have very little to do with why I made the decision to start a new company. If it were, then I would have to consider working more hours to be “flexibility” and paying more bills to be “autonomy.” I already had plenty of opportunity in my previous role. There was absolutely nothing wrong with where I was at. In fact, I loved the people around me (both clients and colleagues) and the work that we did together. It was challenging, provided incredible global brand experience, and gave me the chance to learn from the amazing people around me.</p>
              <p>It’s also not because I think I have a better way of doing things or that I’m a guru, ninja, or whatever the cool kids call knowing everything about the internet these days. I do, however, have are a very particular set of skills (yes, a <em>Taken</em> reference). The reason I started Sitelogic is that I saw an overlap between a unique combination of skills and a real need in the market.</p>
              <h3 id="the-need">The Need</h3>
              <p>This is basic, but businesses need someone to work with who knows a lot about websites and digital marketing. They also need someone they can trust who isn’t going to try to sell them things they don’t need. They need someone to be there who can speak to many different aspects of digital. It&#39;s not that they need a generalist, but that they need someone that knows enough to think both big picture and in the details. Someone to guide and coach them in the areas they’re not familiar with or don’t have time for, but someone who will give them space when wanted. Someone who, yes, needs to make money, but also wants to make them make even more money.</p>
              <p>It&#39;s rare to hear about a business owner or marketing department who isn&#39;t busy. A lot of small businesses start with a website template and then largely ignore the website; they have plenty of other things to worry about. A lot of mid-sized businesses are run by a small or even one person marketing team. These people know that things like analytics and testing are important, but don&#39;t have the bandwidth to do it all. Not every business has the luxury of investing in expensive technology, but many businesses also don&#39;t know how accessible a lot of new technology is.</p>
              <p>Businesses need a partner that&#39;s realistic and trustworthy. They also need a partner with the right set of capabilities to fill in the gaps of where they don&#39;t already have support.</p>
              <h3 id="skills-capabilities">Skills / Capabilities</h3>
              <p>First, my individual skills are not unique. However, the combination is. I’m curious to always learn new things. I’ve worked directly with clients at some of the largest companies in the world and have been fortunate enough to work on digital strategies for iconic, household brand names. I get geeked out by analytics, heatmaps, and Multivariate Testing. I’m not a UX Designer, but my favorite book is “The Design of Everyday Things.” (My wife will vouch for me when I say that I throw a toddler tantrum at every Norman door.)</p>
              <p>I know the value of brand storytelling, even if my other agency friends are way better at it that than I am. I’m partially colorblind, but I’d like to think I have a good eye for design that validates my knowledge of Illustrator and Photoshop. (Also, hex values are very helpful.)</p>
              <p>The buzzword in the industry for a jack of all trades might be “unicorn,” but I&#39;m likely closer to “digital mutt.” Unicorns are flashy, but mutts are real. (Also, I loathe glitter and I&#39;d assume unicorns are usually accompanied by glitter.) Mutts may not always be the first pups to be chosen or the ones that win prizes at the show, but they have a lot to offer.</p>
              <p>You might say, &quot;that&#39;s great for a one-person team, but what about the future?&quot; I&#39;d never expect future team members to have the same set of skills, but I&#39;d always expect them to be curious and hungry to learn more. Maybe a band is a good metaphor. It&#39;s not very practical to need to play every instrument in a five-piece band (even though that would be cool). However, being able to play two instruments could be quite useful. It takes more work, but not as much as knowing five instruments. It could help you understand how to better sync with other bandmates and makes you more valuable in you need to sub someone else in. It could help you build empathy and have a better understanding of the full picture.</p>
              <h3 id="bringing-it-all-together">Bringing it All Together</h3>
              <p>I really like it when things make sense — when supply meets demand; when someone’s knowledge and experience can fill a gap. What I do isn’t revolutionary, it’s practical. In fact, every day when my wife (a Nurse Practitioner) comes home and I hear about her patients, my work feels quite insignificant in comparison. The work that I do is far from life-changing, but I’d like to think that it can still help people: both clients and the clients/customers of their own.</p>
              <p>Why this business exists is to meet practical digital needs. Let me be clear though: practical does not mean boring and typical. A practical need very well might be met through the use of some cutting-edge technology or a wild idea, but the need should always be the focus. I never want to create solutions and then retrofit them for a need.</p>
              <p>That&#39;s it: Sitelogic.</p>
