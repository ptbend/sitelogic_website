              <p>Practical SEO is about making a smart investment of time and money. You can spend far too much of both by focusing on the wrong thing: trying to outsmart the search engines. Spoiler alert: you cannot do that.  I can’t do that either, and anyone telling you otherwise is using smoke and mirrors. It was possible ten years ago, but not today and certainly not tomorrow.</p>
              <p>Search engine optimization has historically been a blend of art and science. The science portion is about understanding what search engines (computers) want to see. The art portion is about what people want to see. Today, these two things are deeply intertwined and are increasingly becoming synonymous as natural language processing and machine learning improve.</p>
              <h3 id="the-foundation-of-your-strategy">The Foundation of Your Strategy</h3>
              <p>Now, down to business. For this to be a practical start, let’s talk in people terms, not computer terms. We can talk about keywords, sitemaps, robots.txt, performance, etc later. For now, think of SEO as a general marketing strategy. There are two things you need to know: what you have to offer and who it is that wants it.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>At its core, SEO is about knowing what people are looking for, what language they use, and where they look for it. Then it&#39;s your job to supply the information.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Write down your answers to these questions on a piece of paper, with the answers to the first section on the left, and the answers to the second section on the right. Yes, they seem simple, but you should have a clear, succinct answer for each.</p>
              <h4 id="what-you-have-to-offer-">What you have to offer:</h4>
              <ul>
              <li>What is unique about your business compared to others?</li>
              <li>What is the &quot;thing&quot; that you sell?</li>
              <li>Why is it different than other products or services?</li>
              </ul>
              <h4 id="who-wants-what-you-have-to-offer-">Who wants what you have to offer:</h4>
              <ul>
              <li>How does this person research purchase decisions?</li>
              <li>What motivates him/her make the final purchase?</li>
              <li>Do a lot of different people want this or only some?</li>
              <li>With what frequency would this person make this purchase?</li>
              <li>Is your current customer the same as your ideal customer? If not, why is that</li>
              <li>Do you have different types of people that could be segmented?</li>
              </ul>
              <p>You may be asking, &quot;what do I do with these now?&quot; Sit tight for a minute and let&#39;s look at an example.</p>
              <h3 id="a-caffeinated-illustration">A Caffeinated Illustration</h3>
              <p>Think of a coffee shop. Go ahead, pick your favorite. Fundamentally, a coffee shop serves the purpose of providing people with coffee. However, when you consider your favorite coffee shop, why do you go there? Is it because it’s convenient? Is it because the quality is high and the beans are freshly roasted? Is because it has free wifi and lots of space so that you don’t feel guilty for sitting there too long despite the fact that the coffee isn’t that great? (I’d never do that, by the way.) In order to tell people about themselves, this coffee should have answers to the same questions that you just answered above. They&#39;d need to know their place in the market and how people want to find them. There would be no way to “do SEO” for a coffee shop without knowing what it has to offer and who the right customer is.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, if someone told me that there’s a coffee shop near the Division Street train stop that has outdoor seating, coffee from three different roasters, and amazing breakfast burritos — we have a little something to work with. We could focus the website on targeting a geographic location, writing about how they pick their roasters, and featuring the awesome vibe on the patio. Maybe not everyone cares that they use coffee from a particular roaster, but the target audience might, so it’s important to make sure they know this about the shop.</p>
              <h3 id="putting-the-pieces-together">Putting the Pieces Together</h3>
              <p>Back to your piece of paper. Look at the two columns and find the overlap between them — the areas where what you have to offer matches what your customers are looking for. Start writing content for these things and begin to use that language on your website and in social. This simple piece of paper is intended to help narrow your focus, not necessarily uncover anything new. You should be focusing on what&#39;s most meaningful rather than trying to do too many things at once.</p>
              <p>You don&#39;t need any fancy SEO tools to figure out what we&#39;ve been talking about. It&#39;s really hard to fool search engines, so don&#39;t focus on that. Use things like Google Analytics to see what content people look at most on your site. If your site has a search feature, review the terms people are using. If you don&#39;t (you should set it up, but) you can simply ask your customers why they do business with you. It will give you a surprisingly good start.</p>
              <p>You don’t have to have all of the answers to start building an SEO strategy, but you need direction that’s rooted at the intersection of what you have to offer and what your customers are looking for. In our next SEO post, we&#39;ll dive into the on-site SEO best practices you should follow once you have your basic strategy.</p>
