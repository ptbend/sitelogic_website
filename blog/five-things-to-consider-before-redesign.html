              <p>A website “redesign” can be a scary term for business owners and marketing teams. Perhaps you’ve had a less-than-ideal experience with one in the past or you “know it&#39;s expensive,” but aren&#39;t sure what that necessarily means.</p>
              <p>Fortunate, jumping into a redesign isn&#39;t something I recommend unless it&#39;s under the right set of circumstances. There&#39;s like plenty that can be done to improve your current site and digital marketing efforts without the same level of investment required for a full redesign. This way, you can make the most of what you have now until you’re ready to commit to a larger project.</p>
              <p>These are the five primary areas I evaluate before a redesign or when I&#39;m making recommendations for improvement: Performance, Usability, Content Management, Brand Clarity, and Security.</p>
              <h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>
              <p>How fast is your site? Ideal, it should load in 3 seconds or less to provide the best experience for a user. This doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s realistic to expect that to always be the case (according to Google, 53% of mobile sites take longer than this to load), but keep it in mind as your goal. First, to test how fast your site is loading, you can use free tools like <a href="https://gtmetrix.com/">GTmetrix</a>, <a href="https://www.webpagetest.org/">WebPageTest</a>, or <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/">Google’s PageSpeed Insights</a> . These tools provide a report on where you&#39;re doing well and what can be improved. You should use the reports as something directional to review with your developers. <em>NOTE:</em> keep in mind that, since the tools are automated, they don&#39;t take into account any specific business or infrastructure reasons for why your code is a certain way. They only look at speed, so a lower score in a specific area may not be too big of an issue.</p>
              <p>For example, when running a page speed scan on my own site, it gets dinged because of analytics and heatmapping tools I use. It also doesn&#39;t recognize my CDN. The results are slightly skewed because of how these things are being tracked, but they do have some impact on how fast the site loads. I know it could be slightly faster, but those tools provide me enough value that it’s a small price to pay (and the site is still quite fast).</p>
              <p>If your hands are tied in making improvements for performance, then you either need a new development team or should start thinking about that redesign. Last but not least, the speed at which your site loads has a direct impact on how search engines prioritize your site. Yes, SEO stuff. Google and Bing use page speed as a factor when prioritizing search results, so don&#39;t ignore it for both your users&#39; and the search engines&#39; sake.</p>
              <h3 id="usability">Usability</h3>
              <p>Can your customers accomplish what they’re looking to do on your site? Do you know? This should be fundamental when considering how successful your site is. Solicit feedback from your users and consider conducting user testing to step aside from your own assumptions and learn what people really think about your site. If you’re considering a redesign, then there you should have a baseline for how people are using what you currently have. This gives you insight into where they may have pain points and also can guide how you make improvements or approach the design of a new site.</p>
              <p>You should be using web analytics tools to gain this knowledge of where your weak points are. Tools that offer heatmaps, screen recording, and funnel analysis are also incredibly helpful. One that I like is <a href="https://www.hotjar.com/">Hotjar</a>. If you&#39;re not sure where to start or how to use these tools, then find a partner (plug for <a href="https://sitelogicdigital.com/contact">Sitelogic</a>) to help.</p>
              <h3 id="content-management">Content Management</h3>
              <p>Are you able to make updates to your site as you wish? Some companies lack the flexibility they need, while others have too much control and just want things to be simple. A number of content management systems (like Squarespace and Wordpress) are specifically designed to provide a large amount of flexibility to content managers. When non-technical or non-design-oriented content managers are given free reign to make updates on a website with one of these tools, it’s very easy for things to become inconsistent. By providing too many options for creating and arranging content, it can be overwhelming for someone who isn&#39;t experienced. It&#39;s like handing the keys of a brand new car to someone that&#39;s never driven before. It&#39;s risky and puts that person in a difficult situation. He/she may be able to get to their destination by going really slowly and bumping into things along the way, but there&#39;s also a risk for a lot worse.</p>
              <p>Then there&#39;s the flip-side: the business who can&#39;t make the basic updates they want to. This situation is certainly frustrating and generally needs to be reviewed on a case-by-case basis of partner. Still, the answer shouldn&#39;t immediately be &quot;redesign.&quot; You may have the opportunity to move to a new platform or to have simple tweaks be done as a small project.</p>
              <h3 id="brand-clarity">Brand Clarity</h3>
              <p>Does your website accurately represent who you are? I mean this in terms of visuals as well as how your story is told through content (images, photography, and written word). It’s much better to be simple, clear, and consistent than it is to have too much disparate content. The right answer for your brand might be to pare down what you have on your site — focus only on the things that portray your message and identity clearly. It should match how you portray yourself on social media and in more traditional marketing channels or in-store. What someone experiences on your website should match the way they interact with it everywhere else. They should immediately recognize your logo, colors, typography, image style, and brand voice.</p>
              <h3 id="security">Security</h3>
              <p>Do you house any user data or other sensitive information? When was the last time you had a security patch or update to your site? This past May, you probably got a whole lot of emails talking about privacy policies. You may be aware that this was because of GDPR (Global Data Protection Regulation — a set of laws put in place that govern websites that have visitors residing within the UK). With the vast amount of information available today, there&#39;s good reason that this is a hot topic of conversation. There is plenty of attention on the subject right now and you owe it to your customers to protect their data. Your business depends on it.</p>
              <p>Regular updates and security monitoring is especially important for Wordpress sites. If you run a Wordpress site and haven’t paid attention to Wordpress security, this should become a top priority for you, especially if house any customer data. Hosted SaaS solutions (like Shopify and Squarespace) have dedicated teams that focus on security. While you still need to pay attention to where you collect data and how it&#39;s stored, they have prepared the infrastructure to help you maintain a secure site.</p>
              <h2 id="making-the-decision">Making the Decision</h2>
              <p>If only one or two of these areas are a challenge for you, then your current site is likely a great candidate for improvements, rather than an immediate redesign. If three or more these areas are a significant challenge for you, then it may be a smarter investment to put in the proper time and money for a redesign, but don’t jump into it too quickly.</p>
              <p>Before making any moves, take the time to clearly define your business goals, identify your audience, clarify your message, and solidify your brand identity. Keep it concise. Then, find the right partner to help you through the process of a redesign. This should be someone who will challenge you with the right questions. A good digital partner should always be willing to tell you what you need, as well as what you don&#39;t need. They should also have a methodology for how they come to recommendations and solutions, rather than having a cookie-cutter solution. The needs of your business are unique, so make sure they&#39;re met. While templated sites have their time and place, a true redesign entails research, strategy, and testing to create a site that will last far into the future. A good partner will help you get there, so make sure both you (and they) are focused on these five key areas.</p>
